/**
 * DESCRIPTION: <br>
 * Single Calibration. Describes a piece of data which is usually constant, but
 * can be overridden by a cal wrangler from a csv file on the RIO's filesystem.
 * This enables a software team to control what a pit crew has control over
 * (Shooter speed is a good candidate. Port number for left drivetrain motor A
 * is a bad candidate). <br>
 * <br>
 * USAGE:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Instantiate the calibration with a default value, and reference to the
 * wrangler</li>
 * <li>At runtime, use the get() method to read the calibrated value. The
 * returned value may change depending on what the wrangler has
 * overwritten.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
